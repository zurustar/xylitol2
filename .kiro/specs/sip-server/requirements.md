# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing a SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) Server that complies with RFC3261. The SIP Server will function as both a Stateful Proxy and Registrar to handle session establishment, modification, and termination for real-time communication applications. The server will support UDP and TCP transport protocols and implement Session-Timer functionality as specified in RFC4028.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a SIP client, I want to register my location with the SIP server, so that other clients can reach me for communication sessions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a SIP client sends a REGISTER request THEN the server SHALL authenticate the client using digest authentication
2. WHEN authentication is successful THEN the server SHALL store the client's contact information in the location database
3. WHEN a REGISTER request contains an Expires header THEN the server SHALL honor the expiration time for the registration
4. WHEN a registration expires THEN the server SHALL remove the contact information from the location database
5. IF a REGISTER request contains invalid credentials THEN the server SHALL respond with a 401 Unauthorized status

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a SIP client, I want to initiate communication sessions through the SIP server, so that I can establish voice, video, or messaging sessions with other clients.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a SIP client sends an INVITE request THEN the server SHALL validate the request format according to RFC3261
2. WHEN the target user is registered THEN the server SHALL forward the INVITE to the appropriate client
3. WHEN the target user is not registered THEN the server SHALL respond with a 404 Not Found status
4. WHEN a client sends a provisional response THEN the server SHALL forward it to the originating client
5. WHEN a final response is received THEN the server SHALL forward it and establish the session state

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a SIP client, I want the server to handle session modifications and termination, so that I can update or end communication sessions properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends a re-INVITE request THEN the server SHALL process it as a session modification
2. WHEN a client sends a BYE request THEN the server SHALL forward it to terminate the session
3. WHEN a BYE response is received THEN the server SHALL clean up the session state
4. WHEN a client sends a CANCEL request THEN the server SHALL cancel the pending INVITE transaction
5. IF a session timeout occurs THEN the server SHALL clean up the associated session state

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a SIP client, I want the server to handle various SIP methods correctly, so that I can use the full range of SIP functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client sends an OPTIONS request THEN the server SHALL respond with supported methods and capabilities
2. WHEN a client sends an ACK request THEN the server SHALL handle it according to transaction state
3. WHEN a client sends an INFO request THEN the server SHALL forward it within an established dialog
4. WHEN receiving unsupported methods THEN the server SHALL respond with 405 Method Not Allowed
5. WHEN receiving malformed requests THEN the server SHALL respond with 400 Bad Request

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a network administrator, I want the SIP server to handle multiple concurrent sessions efficiently, so that it can serve many users simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple clients register simultaneously THEN the server SHALL handle all registrations concurrently
2. WHEN multiple INVITE requests are received THEN the server SHALL process them in parallel
3. WHEN the server reaches capacity limits THEN it SHALL respond with 503 Service Unavailable
4. WHEN processing requests THEN the server SHALL maintain transaction state correctly for each session
5. IF memory or connection limits are exceeded THEN the server SHALL gracefully reject new requests

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the SIP server to provide proper logging and monitoring, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system health.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing SIP messages THEN the server SHALL log all transactions with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN errors occur THEN the server SHALL log error details with timestamps and context
3. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL log configuration parameters and startup status
4. WHEN clients register or unregister THEN the server SHALL log these events
5. IF critical errors occur THEN the server SHALL log them with ERROR level priority

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a SIP client, I want the server to support both UDP and TCP transport protocols, so that I can communicate using my preferred transport method.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL listen on both UDP and TCP ports for SIP messages
2. WHEN a client sends a SIP message over UDP THEN the server SHALL process it according to RFC3261 UDP handling rules
3. WHEN a client sends a SIP message over TCP THEN the server SHALL process it according to RFC3261 TCP handling rules
4. WHEN responding to UDP requests THEN the server SHALL use UDP for responses unless message size exceeds MTU
5. WHEN responding to TCP requests THEN the server SHALL maintain the TCP connection for the response

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a SIP client, I want the server to enforce Session-Timer functionality as mandatory, so that all sessions are properly managed with automatic refresh or termination.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing INVITE requests THEN the server SHALL require Session-Expires header according to RFC4028
2. WHEN an INVITE lacks Session-Timer support THEN the server SHALL reject it with 421 Extension Required
3. WHEN a session timer is active THEN the server SHALL track the session refresh interval

5. WHEN receiving re-INVITE for session refresh THEN the server SHALL reset the session timer

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want user credentials to be stored persistently in a database, so that user information is maintained across server restarts and can be managed efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL initialize a SQLite database for user credential storage
2. WHEN user credentials are created or modified THEN they SHALL be stored persistently in the database
3. WHEN the server restarts THEN it SHALL retain all previously stored user credentials
4. WHEN authentication is required THEN the server SHALL retrieve credentials from the database
5. IF database operations fail THEN the server SHALL log errors and handle gracefully

### Requirement 10

5. IF web interface operations fail THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 11

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the SIP server to be configurable, so that it can be adapted to different deployment environments and requirements.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN it SHALL read configuration from a configuration file
2. WHEN configuration specifies UDP and TCP listening ports THEN the server SHALL bind to those ports
3. WHEN configuration specifies authentication settings THEN the server SHALL use those parameters
4. WHEN configuration specifies Session-Timer defaults THEN the server SHALL apply those settings
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the server SHALL report errors and fail to start gracefully

### Requirement 12

**User Story:** As a SIP server, I want to process Session-Timer validation with appropriate priority, so that authentication and session timer requirements are both enforced correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN processing INVITE requests THEN the server SHALL validate Session-Timer headers before authentication when appropriate
2. WHEN Session-Timer validation fails THEN the server SHALL respond with 421 Extension Required before authentication challenges
3. WHEN both Session-Timer and authentication are required THEN the server SHALL prioritize based on RFC compliance requirements
4. WHEN Session-Timer validation passes THEN the server SHALL proceed with authentication flow
5. IF Session-Timer validation conflicts with authentication flow THEN the server SHALL follow RFC4028 precedence rules

### Requirement 13

2. WHEN TCP connections are established THEN the server SHALL maintain them properly for the duration of message exchanges
3. WHEN TCP message framing occurs THEN the server SHALL handle partial messages and reassembly correctly
4. WHEN TCP connections are idle THEN the server SHALL manage connection lifecycle appropriately
5. IF TCP processing errors occur THEN the server SHALL log detailed error information and recover gracefully
